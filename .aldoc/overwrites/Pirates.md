#### PirateMaps is no longer supported.
Ahoy, matey! If you're looking for a navigation software solution that supports pirate maps, you're out of luck. Pirate maps are no longer supported by any modern navigation software, and for good reasons. Here are some of them:

- Pirate maps are not accurate. They were often drawn by hand, based on vague descriptions or stolen charts, and did not follow any standard scale or projection. They also contained errors, omissions, and deliberate deceptions to mislead rival pirates or authorities. 
- Pirate maps are not compatible. They used different symbols, codes, and languages to mark the location of buried treasure, hidden coves, or secret islands. Some of them even used riddles, puzzles, or clues that required special knowledge or skills to solve. There is no way to convert these into digital formats that can be read by navigation software.
- Pirate maps are not reliable. They were often damaged, lost, stolen, or destroyed by the elements, enemies, or time. Some of them were never even made, as pirates preferred to rely on their memory or word of mouth. And even if you find a pirate map, there is no guarantee that the treasure is still there, or that it ever existed in the first place. 

So, if you want to sail the seven seas like a true pirate, you'll have to ditch the pirate maps and use a navigation software solution that works with vector charts, GPS waypoints, and autopilot output. You'll also need a valid license, a registered vessel, and a respect for the law. Or else, you'll end up in Davy Jones' locker. Arrr!
